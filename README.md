# 🧠 DSA Journey

Welcome to my ** DSA Journey** — a dedicated repository where I document my step-by-step progress through the popular [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) Data Structures & Algorithms roadmap.

---

## 🚀 Why this journey?

I'm building a strong foundation in problem-solving and preparing for technical interviews by tackling each problem with focus, consistency, and understanding — not just solutions, but the **why and how** behind them.

---

## 🗂️ What's inside?

- ✅ Solutions to NeetCode problems (in Python)
- 📌 Clean code with clear logic and comments
- 🧪 Practice with edge cases and constraints
- 📈 Tracked progress across Easy, Medium, and Hard problems

---

## 📅 My Goals

- Solve all problems in the **NeetCode 150** list
- Focus on pattern recognition and optimization
- Improve coding speed and confidence
- Be interview-ready 💼
